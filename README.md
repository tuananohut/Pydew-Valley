# Pydew Valley

Hello, all. This is Pydew Valley. Pydew Valley is a clone of Stardew Valley. This game is a type of farming simulation.

I made this game by following this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4IX36sP_0c. 

## What Did I Learn From This Project?

- Basic os usage

- Basic pygame usage

        - Player movement
        - Creating sprite
        - Sprite groups
        - Camera
        - Animation
        - Music
        - Delta time

- Basic PyTMX usage

- File and module management.

## How To Play?

Make sure python and these libraries are installed on your computer:

python download link: https://www.python.org/downloads/


- pygame (download for windows)

        
        pip install pygame 
- PyTMX (download for windows)

        pip install PyTMX


If you're sure that you've downloaded all the libraries and files, you need to run the main.py file to play.

Walk: Arrow keys

Tool Switch: Q

Tool Use: Space

Seed Change: E

Seed Use: LCTRL

To open the shopping menu, you first need to go to the merchant. It won't open if you try before that. When you're next to the merchant, press the "Enter" key. To buy or sell something, press the "Space" key, and to close the menu, press the "Esc" key.

You don't need to press an extra key to harvest when plants grow. You just need to perform a collision.

To start a new day, go to the blue carpet next to the bed and press the Enter key.

## What Did I Change?

- I add Start button.

- I changed the order of adding libraries. I organized them as follows: 
                
        Python libraries, 
        downloaded libraries from the internet,                
        my own custom libraries.

- If I've created two classes in one file, I've left 3 spaces in between. I left 2 spaces between functions. I did this to make the code more readable.

- I changed UI a little bit. Because it was a bit complex.

- I changed SFX.


### Possible errors you may encounter while playing:

- Error: Apples and particles not appearing. If you run the game multiple times, apples and particle effects won't appear. I don't know the cause of this error.
        
- Be careful not to accidentally press the LCTRL key, as it will decrease your seeds.

- List index out of range

### General Info About The Game

- There's no water bar; you can water as much as you like.

- Cut trees do not regrow, and you cannot plant new trees. If you pick apples, they will grow again the next day.

- You can't step on plants when they grow a bit. Sometimes, this can be quite frustrating.

- If you don't water the plants, they won't grow. They won't rot either.
